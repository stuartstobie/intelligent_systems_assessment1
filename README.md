# Intelligent Systems Assessment 1

Genetic Algorithm designed to solve: `f(x)=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3+ex^4+fx^5` for the data given in datfile.

To run simply type `python ga.py` and watch it whir away. This generates a csv with the results.

Feel free to change the values at the top of the python file which affect mutation rates and tournament size.
